                  <li class="lead"> Fact 1: Venus is often called "Earth’s twin" because they’re similar in size and
                    structure, but Venus has extreme surface heat and a dense, toxic atmosphere. If the Sun were as tall
                    as a typical front door, Earth and Venus would each be about the size of a nickel. </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 2: Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun, orbiting at a distance of
                    about 67 million miles (108 million kilometers) </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 3: Venus rotates very slowly on its axis – one day on Venus lasts 243 Earth
                    days. The planet orbits the Sun faster than Earth, however, so one year on Venus takes only about
                    225 Earth days, making a Venusian day longer than its year! </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 4: Venus has a solid surface covered in dome-like volcanoes, rifts, and
                    mountains, with expansive volcanic plains and vast, ridged plateaus. </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 5: The average surface of Venus is less than a billion years old, and possibly
                    as young as 150 million years old – which is relatively young from a geological perspective. This is
                    a major conundrum for scientists – they don’t know exactly what happened that made Venus completely
                    resurface itself. </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 6: Venus’ thick atmosphere traps heat creating a runaway greenhouse effect –
                    making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.
                    The greenhouse effect makes Venus roughly 700°F (390°C) hotter than it would be without a greenhouse
                    effect. </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 7: Venus is permanently shrouded in thick, toxic clouds of sulfuric acid that
                    start at an altitude of 28 to 43 miles (45 to 70 kilometers). The clouds smell like rotten eggs!
                  </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 8: Venus was the first planet explored by a spacecraft and was intensely
                    studied early in the history of space exploration. Venus was also the first planet whose surface was
                    reached by a spacecraft from Earth. The intense heat means landers have only survived for a couple
                    of hours. </li>

                  <li class="lead"> Fact 1: Neptune is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were a large apple,
                    Neptune would be the size of a basketball. </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 2: Neptune orbits our Sun, a star, and is the eighth planet from the Sun at a
                    distance of about 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers). </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 3: Neptune takes about 16 hours to rotate once (a Neptunian day), and about 165
                    Earth years to orbit the sun (a Neptunian year). </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 4: Neptune is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy"
                    materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core. </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 5: Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of molecular hydrogen, atomic helium
                    and methane. </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 6: Neptune has 14 known moons which are named after sea gods and nymphs in
                    Greek mythology. </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 7: Neptune has at least five main rings and four more ring arcs, which are
                    clumps of dust and debris likely formed by the gravity of a nearby moon. </li>
                  <li class="lead"> Fact 8: Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. No spacecraft has
                    orbited this distant planet to study it at length and up close. </li>
